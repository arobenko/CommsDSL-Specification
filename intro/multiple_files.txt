=== Multiple Files ===
For big protocols it is possible and even recommended to split schema definition
into multiple files. The code generator **must** accept a list of schema files to
process and **must** process them in requested order.

Every subsequently processed schema file must **NOT** change any properties 
specified by the first processed schema file. It is allowed to omit any properties
that have already been defined. For example:

First processed file:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big" version="2">
    ...
</schema>
----
Second processed file:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    ...
</schema>
----
It must be accepted by the code generator because it does **NOT** change previously
defined **name**, **endian**, and **version**. The second file doesn't mention
**version** at all.

However, the following third file must cause an error due to changing the
**endian** value:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="little">
    ...
</schema>
----
Also note, that all the properties have some default value and cannot be
defined in second or later processed file while been omitted in the first one.

For example, the first file doesn't specify version number (which defaults to **0**)
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    ...
</schema>
----
The following second file must cause an error due to an attempt to override
**version** property with different value.
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" version="2">
    ...
</schema>
----
