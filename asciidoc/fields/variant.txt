[[fields-variant]]
=== &lt;variant&gt; Field ===
This field is basically a *union* of other <<fields-fields, fields>>. 
It can hold only one field at a time out of the provided list of supported
<<fields-fields, fields>>. The **&lt;variant&gt;** field has all the <<fields-common, common>> properties
as well as extra properties and elements described below.

==== Member Fields ====
The **&lt;variant&gt;** field is there to support heterogeneous lists of fields.
The classic example would be a list of *key-value* pairs, where numeric *key*
defines what type of *value* follows. Similar to <<fields-bundle, &lt;bundle&gt; >>
field, member fields need to be listed as children XML elements of the **&lt;variant&gt;**.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    <fields>
        <int name="Key" type="uint8" failOnInvalid="true" displayReadOnly="true" />

        <variant name="Property">
            <bundle name="Prop1">
                <int reuse="Key" defaultValue="0" validValue="0" />
                <int name="Value" type="uint32" />
            </bundle>
            <bundle name="Prop2">
                <int reuse="Key" defaultValue="1" validValue="1" />
                <string name="Value" length="16" />
            </bundle>
        </variant>
        
        <list name="PropertiesList" element="Property" />
    </fields>
</schema>
----
The example above defines every *key-value* pair as <<fields-bundle, &lt;bundle&gt; >>
field, where first field (*key*) reuses external definition of *Key* field and
adds its default construction value as well as what value considered to be valid.
**NOTE**, that every *key* member sets **failOnInvalid** property to **true**. 
The code generator is expected to generate code that attempts *read* operation
of every defined member field in the order of their definition. Once the *read*
operation is successful, the right member has been found and the *read* operation 
needs to terminate. The *in-order* read is high level logic, the code generator
is allowed to introduce optimizations as long as the outcome of detecting the
right member is the same.

If there is any other <<intro-properties, property>> defined as XML child
of the **&lt;variant&gt;**, then all the members must be wrapped in 
**&lt;members&gt;** XML element for separation.

                ...
            </members>

Another quite popular example of is to have heterogeneous list of 
TLV (type / length / value) triplets.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    <fields>
        <int name="Type" type="uint8" failOnInvalid="true" displayReadOnly="true" />

        <variant name="Property">
            <bundle name="Prop1">
                <int reuse="Type" defaultValue="0" validValue="0" />
                <int name="Length" type="uint16" semanticType="length" />
                <int name="Value" type="uint32" />
            </bundle>
            <bundle name="Prop2">
                <int reuse="Type" defaultValue="1" validValue="1" />
                <int name="Length" type="uint16" semanticType="length" />
                <string name="Value" />
            </bundle>
            ... 
        </variant>
        
        <list name="PropertiesList" element="Property" />
    </fields>
</schema>
----
Please **note** assigning **semanticType** property to be **length** for the
*Length* field in every bundle. It specifies that the field contains
remaining length of all the subsequent fields in the **&lt;bundle&gt;** and
allows the code generator to produce correct code. The support for
**length** value of **semanticType** has been introduced in **v2** of this
specification.

Quite often the developers wonder why there is a need to use *remaining length*
information for the fields, length of which is constant and known and compile time.
It allows introducing more fields in future versions of the protocol while
preserving forward / backward compatibility of the protocol. For example:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big" version="2">
    <fields>
        <int name="Type" type="uint8" failOnInvalid="true" displayReadOnly="true" />

        <variant name="Property">
            <bundle name="Prop1">
                <int reuse="Type" defaultValue="0" validValue="0" />
                <int name="Length" type="uint16" semanticType="length" />
                <int name="Value" type="uint32" />
                <int name="Value2" type="int16" sinceVersion="2"/>
            </bundle>
            ... 
        </variant>
        
        <list name="PropertiesList" element="Property" />
    </fields>
</schema>
----
The old version of the protocol code, that is not aware of extra field being
added in the new version, will be able to skip over unknown data and read
the next property from the correct location.

It also allows safe reception and handling of unexpected (or unknown) properties that could be 
introduced in the future versions of the protocol while still operating correctly.
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    <fields>
        <int name="Type" type="uint8" failOnInvalid="true" displayReadOnly="true" />

        <variant name="Property">
            ...
            <bundle name="UnknownProp">
                <int reuse="Type" failOnInvalid="false" />
                <int name="Length" type="uint16" semanticType="length" />
                <data name="Value" />
            </bundle>
        </variant>
        
        <list name="PropertiesList" element="Property" />
    </fields>
</schema>
----
**NOTE**, that in the example above the *UnknownProp* is defined to
be the last member field of the **&lt;variant&gt;** field and has
non-failing read of its *Type* (**failOnInvalid** property has been set
to **false**).

==== Default Member ====
When **&lt;variant&gt;** field is constructed, it should not hold any
field and when serialized, it mustn't produce any output. 
However, it is possible to specify default member to which
the **&lt;variant&gt;** field should be initialized when constructed.
To specify such member use **defaultMember** <<intro-properties, property>>.
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    <fields>
        <variant name="Property" defaultMember="Prop1">
            <bundle name="Prop1">
                ...
            </bundle>
            ...
        </variant>
    </fields>
</schema>
----
The **defaultMember** property may also specify index instead of the member 
name.
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    <fields>
        <variant name="Property" defaultMember="0">
            <bundle name="Prop1">
                ...
            </bundle>
            ...
        </variant>
    </fields>
</schema>
----
Negative number as value of **defaultMember** property will force the 
**&lt;variant&gt;** field not to have a default member.

==== Extra Display Property ====
By default GUI protocol analysis tools should display the index of the 
held member when displaying **&lt;variant&gt;** field in "read only" mode.
However, for some occasions this information may be irrelevant. To hide
display of index use **displayIdxReadOnlyHidden** 
<<intro-properties, property>> with <<intro-boolean, boolean>> value.
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<schema name="MyProtocol" endian="big">
    <fields>
        <variant name="Property" displayIdxReadOnlyHidden="true">
            <bundle name="Prop1">
                ...
            </bundle>
            ...
        </variant>
