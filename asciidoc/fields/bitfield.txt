[[fields-bitfield]]
=== &lt;bitfield&gt; Field ===
The **&lt;bitfield&gt;** is a container field, which allows wrapped member fields
to be serialized using limited number of bits (instead of bytes). 
The supported fields, that can be members of the **&lt;bitfield&gt;**, are:

* <<fields-enum, &lt;enum&gt; >>
* <<fields-int, &lt;int&gt; >>
* <<fields-set, &lt;set&gt; >>

Since **v2** of the specification it is also allowed to use 
<<fields-ref, &lt;ref&gt; >> field, which references one of the field types above.

The **&lt;bitfield&gt;** field has all the <<fields-common, common>> properties
as well as extra properties and elements described below.

==== Member Fields ====
Member fields need to be listed as children XML elements of the **&lt;bitfield&gt;**.
Every such member is expected to use **bitLength** property to specify its
serialization length **in bits**. If it is not specified, then length in bits
is calculated automatically as length **in bytes** multiplied by **8**.

    <fields>
        <bitfield name="SomeBitfield">
            <int name="SomeIntMember" type="uint8" bitLength="3" />
            <set name="SomeSetMember" bitLength="3">
                ...
            </set>
            <enum name="SomeEnumMember" type="uint8" bitLength="2">
                ...
            </enum>
        </bitfield>
    </fields>
</schema>

**NOTE** that summary of all the lengths in bits of all the members must be
divisible by **8** and mustn't exceed **64** bits, otherwise the code generator 
must report an error.

The members of **&lt;bitfield&gt;** must be listed in order starting from the
**least** significant bit. In the example above *SomeIntMember* occupies bits
[0 - 2], *SomeSetMember* occupies bits [3 - 5], and *SomeEnumMember* occupies
bits [6 -7].

If there is any other <<intro-properties, property>> defined as XML child
of the **&lt;bitfield&gt;**, then all the members must be wrapped in 
**&lt;members&gt;** XML element for separation.

==== Endian ====
When serializing, the **&lt;bitfield&gt;** object needs to combine the
values of all the members into single unsigned raw value of appropriate length,
and write the received value using appropriate endian.
By default **endian** of the <<schema-schema, schema>> is used, unless it
is overridden using extra **endian** property of the **&lt;bitfield&gt;** field.
